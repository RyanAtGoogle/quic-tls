<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">QUIC <a href="#I-D.tsvwg-quic-protocol">[I-D.tsvwg-quic-protocol]</a> provides a multiplexed transport for HTTP <a href="#RFC7230">[RFC7230]</a> semantics that provides several key advantages over HTTP/1.1 <a href="#RFC7230">[RFC7230]</a> or HTTP/2 <a href="#RFC7540">[RFC7540]</a> over TCP <a href="#RFC0793">[RFC0793]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The custom security protocol designed for QUIC provides critical latency improvements for connection establishment.  Absent packet loss, most new connections can be established with a single round trip; on subsequent connections between the same client and server, the client can often send application data immediately, that is, zero round trip setup.  TLS 1.3 uses a similar design and aims to provide the same set of improvements.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This document describes how the standardized TLS 1.3 might serve as a security layer for QUIC.  The same design could work for TLS 1.2, though few of the benefits QUIC provides would be realized due to the handshake latency in versions of TLS prior to 1.3.</p>
<p/>

<dl>
  <dt>Alternative Designs:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">There are other designs that are possible; and many of these alternative designs are likely to be equally good.  The point of this document is to articulate a coherent single design.  Notes like this throughout the document are used describe points where alternatives were considered.</dd>

<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">QUIC <a href="#I-D.tsvwg-quic-protocol">[I-D.tsvwg-quic-protocol]</a> can be separated into several modules:</p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>The basic frame envelope describes the common packet layout.  This layer includes connection identification, version negotiation, and includes the indicators that allow the framing, public reset, and FEC modules to be identified.</li>
  <li>The public reset is an unprotected frame that allows an intermediary (an entity that is not part of the security context) to request the termination of a QUIC connection.</li>
  <li>The forward error correction (FEC) module provides redundant entropy that allows for frames to be repaired in event of loss.</li>
  <li>Framing comprises most of the QUIC protocol.  Framing provides a number of different types of frame, each with a specific purpose.  Framing supports frames for both congestion management and stream multiplexing.  Framing additionally provides a liveness testing capability (the PING frame).</li>
  <li>Crypto provides confidentiality and integrity protection for frames.  All frames are protected after the handshake completes on stream 1.  Prior to this, data is protected with the 0-RTT keys.</li>
  <li>Multiplexed streams are the primary payload of QUIC.  These provide reliable, in-order delivery of data and are used to carry the encryption handshake and transport parameters (stream 1), HTTP header fields (stream 3), and HTTP requests and responses.  Frames for managing multiplexing include those for creating and destroying streams as well as flow control and priority frames.</li>
  <li>Congestion management includes packet acknowledgment and other signal required to ensure effective use of available link capacity.</li>
  <li>HTTP mapping provides an adaptation to HTTP that is based on HTTP/2.</li>

<p/>

<ul>
  <li>A full handshake in which the client is able to send application data after one round trip and the server immediately after receiving the first message from the client.</li>
  <li>A 0-RTT handshake in which the client uses information about the server to send immediately.  This data can be replayed by an attacker so it MUST NOT carry a self-contained trigger for any non-idempotent action.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.4">Two additional variations on this basic handshake exchange are relevant to this document:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The server can respond to a ClientHello with a HelloRetryRequest, which adds an additional round trip prior to the basic exchange.  This is needed if the server wishes to request a different key exchange key from the client.  HelloRetryRequest might also be used to verify that the client is correctly able to receive packets on the address it claims to have (see <a href="#source-address">Section 4.2</a>).</li>
  <li>A pre-shared key mode can be used for subsequent handshakes to avoid public key operations.  This might be the basis for 0-RTT, even if the remainder of the connection is protected by a new Diffie-Hellman exchange.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">The QUIC version negotiation mechanism is used to negotiate the version of QUIC that is used prior to the completion of the handshake.  However, this packet is not authenticated, enabling an active attacker to force a version downgrade.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">Each QUIC version has an equivalent Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) <a href="#RFC7301">[RFC7301]</a> label defined.

<h2 id="rfc.section.4.2"><a href="#rfc.section.4.2">4.2.</a> <a href="#source-address" id="source-address">Source Address Validation</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">QUIC implementations describe a source address token.  This is an opaque blob that a server provides to clients when they first use a given source address.  The client returns this token in subsequent messages as a return routeability check.  That is, the client returns this token to prove that it is able to receive packets at the source address that it claims.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">Since this token is opaque and consumed only by the server, it can be included in the TLS 1.3 configuration identifier for 0-RTT handshakes.  Servers that use 0-RTT are advised to provide new configuration identifiers after every handshake to avoid passive linkability of connections from the same client.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">A server that is under load might include the same information in the cookie extension/field of a HelloRetryRequest. (Note: the current version of TLS 1.3 does not include the ability to include a cookie in HelloRetryRequest.)</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5"><a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> <a href="#record-protection" id="record-protection">Record Protection</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">Each TLS record is encapsulated in the QUIC envelope.  This provides length information, which means that the length field can be dropped from the TLS record.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">The sequence number used by TLS record protection is changed to deal with the potential for packets to be dropped or lost.  The QUIC sequence number is used in place of the monotonically increasing TLS record sequence number.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">This represents a significant change to TLS record protection and the guarantees that it provides.  QUIC has a single, contiguous sequence number space.  In comparison, TLS restarts its sequence number each time that record protection keys are changed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.4">The restart in TLS ensures that a compromise of the current traffic keys does not allow an attacker to truncate the data that is sent after a key update by sending additional packets under the old key (causing new packets to be discarded).  In comparison, QUIC does not rely on this having integrity for a continuous sequence of application data packets.  Since QUIC is UDP-based, it is trivial for either an attacker or random chance to cause truncation of the squence of packets at any time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.5">QUIC deals with this by providing authenticated repair mechansims that operate above the layer of encryption.  QUIC can therefore operate without restarting sequence numbers.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.5.1"><a href="#rfc.section.5.1">5.1.</a> <a href="#alternative-design-exporters" id="alternative-design-exporters">Alternative Design: Exporters</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">An exporter could be used to provide keying material for a QUIC-specific record protection.  This could draw on the selected cipher suite and the TLS record protection design so that the overall effort required to design and analyze is kept minimal.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">One concern with using exporters is that TLS doesn&#8217;t define an exporter for use prior to the end of the handshake.  That means the creation of a special exporter for use in protecting 0-RTT data.  That&#8217;s a pretty sharp object to leave lying around, and it&#8217;s not clear what the properties we could provide.  (That doesn&#8217;t mean that there wouldn&#8217;t be demand for such a thing, the possibility has already been raised.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">In the end, using an exporter doesn&#8217;t alter the design significantly.  Given the risks, a modification to the record protocol is probably safer.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.5.2"><a href="#rfc.section.5.2">5.2.</a> <a href="#key-update" id="key-update">Key Update</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">Each time that the TLS record protection keys are changed, the message initiating the change could be lost.  This results in subsequent packets being indecipherable to the peer that receives them.  Key changes happen during the handshake directly after ClientHello or ServerHello messages and they occur immediately after a KeyUpdate message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">TLS relies on an ordered, reliable transport and therefore provides no other mechanism to ensure that a peer receives the message initiating a key change prior to receiving the subsequent messages that are protected using the new key.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.3">A peer that receives an indecipherable packet immediately following a lost packet is therefore required to test whether the incoming packet can be decrypted under an imminent traffic key.  If the packet cannot be decrypted, then it is dropped.  If the packet can be decrypted under the new traffic key, it MUST switch to using that new traffic key for all subsequent packets.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.4">This logic isn&#8217;t necessary for a server receiving a ClientHello.  In that case, the client cannot send encrypted data until it receives a ServerHello.  If a ClientHello is dropped, then any 0-RTT data that is sent by the client cannot be decrypted and is discarded.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.5">Key update messages MUST still be sent reliably, even though a peer can operate without receiving the message.  A peer MUST NOT speculatively decrypt packets until it has sent an acknowledgment for the key update (or handshake message) that caused the current record protection keys to be emplaced.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.6">To limit the number of keys that a receiver needs to test, a peer MUST await a positive acknowledgement for a key update message before sending another.  Also, a peer MUST await the completion of the TLS handshake before initiating a key update.</p>

  <dd style="margin-left: 8">This section doesn&#8217;t deal with partial loss of these packets for simplicity reasons.  It would be highly unlikely that these packets would be large enough to warrant fragmentation such that partial data could be recovered and used to derive traffic keys.</dd>
  <dt>Alternative design:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">We could easily forbid the use of KeyUpdate, which could limit the amount of data that a single connection is able to transfer.  This limit is pretty big, but maybe not big enough.</dd>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">Implementations MUST NOT exchange data on any stream other than stream 1 prior to the TLS handshake completing.  However, QUIC requires the use of several types of frame for managing loss detection and recovery.  In addition, it might be useful to use the data acquired during the exchange of unauthenticated messages for congestion management.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">The actions that a peer takes as a result of receiving an unauthenticated packet needs tobe limited.  In particular, state established by these packets cannot be retained once record protection commences.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">There are several approaches possible for dealing with unauthenticated packets prior to handshake completion:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>discard and ignore them</li>
  <li>use them, but reset any state that is established once the handshake completes</li>
  <li>use them and authenticate them afterwards; failing the handshake if they can&#8217;t be authenticated</li>
  <li>save them and use them when they can be properly authenticated</li>
  <li>treat them as a fatal error</li>

A connection restart would avoid this issue.</dd>
